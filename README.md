This is a small, interactive web project built to demonstrate the power and simplicity of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for high-performance JavaScript animations.

The site features [briefly describe the main animation/feature, e.g., "a responsive scrolling parallax effect," "a staggered entrance animation for text and images," or "an interactive timeline animation controlled by a button"].

üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies
HTML5 / CSS3: Structure and styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): Logic and interaction.

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): The core library used for all animations.

‚ú® Features
[Animation Feature 1]: A smooth [type of animation, e.g., fade-in, parallax, rotation] on the [element, e.g., main header, background image].

[Animation Feature 2]: Uses GSAP Timelines to sequence multiple animations, creating a cohesive flow.

[Interaction Feature, if applicable]: Implementation of [GSAP ScrollTrigger] for viewport-based animations or a user-controlled element using [GSAP Draggable].

Clean Code: Animations are modular and easily adjustable.
